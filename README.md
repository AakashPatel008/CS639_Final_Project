# CS639_Final_Project
Pace University Mobile Application Development Final Project <br><br>
# PaceFlex

## Description

Data from Everfi shows that over half of college students are unable to manage their finances and that more than half are concerned about having enough money to get them through the semester. Students require a management system to control their cash flow and warn them when they are about to overspend. We'd like to introduce you to "Paceflex" an application for smartphones that can aid with handling your finances.

## Features
-	User-friendly Interface
